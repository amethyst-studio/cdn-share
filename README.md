## Examples

You can visit our [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/amethyst-studio/sc-cdn-server/wiki) for information in setting up and using this service.

If you are ever having any trouble, I would greatly recommend visiting the Wiki or opening a discussion to ask us questions directly. Issues will be converted to discussions if they do not follow the pre-determined issue templates.

Configure your environment with both the `.env.template` and `ecosystem.config.json`, although we do not recommend changing the ecosystem at this time, if it can be helped.

```bash
bash ./scripts/upgrade.sh # For initial install and future upgrades, run this script.
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```
